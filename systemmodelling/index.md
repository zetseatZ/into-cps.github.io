# System Modelling with Modelio

## Description##

Modelio is a combined UML/BPMN modeler supporting a wide range of models and diagrams.

Modelio's main features:

* SysML support integrated with UML and BPMN
* XMI import and export
* Scripting language support (Jython)
* Extensibility: Modelio can be extended for any language, methodology or modeling technique just by adding modules. You can either use existing modules or else develop your own.
