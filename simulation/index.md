# Simulation

A simulation starts by defining the connection between FMU instances at the system modelling level. This is then used to start the COE.

1. Define connections in SysML
2. Export the connections to the INTO-CPS App (not developed yet)
3. Start the COE with the connections

This assumes that all FMUs has been developed in one of the Simulators and exported prior to this.
